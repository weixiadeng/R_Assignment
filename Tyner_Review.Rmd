```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##My Suggestions

#Data Inspection
```{r}
#Did you do this section? I can't find it, if you did I would separate it into a different chunk and label it
```

#Data Processing
```{r}
#I think he said to avoid for loops, they're in both data processing sections. You might try to find a work around.

#Not sure if this will count against you, but no actual files were generated by processing your data, just tables in the environment.
```

#Visualization
```{r}
#You should separate your graphs into different chunks that match which visualization you're performing. Right now, I was a bit lost as to which graphs went with which section

#Nice genotype across chromosome graph!
```
